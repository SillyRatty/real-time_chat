# Real-Time Chat
## Simple node.js script for a real time local chat application.

A web chat application using html, css and js, running the server.js file with node.js will create a local host at port 1000, you can then access it by typing "localhost:1000" in your browser.

You can also host it for other devices in the same local network, to do that, you need to put your local ipv4 adress in the server.js file, more instructions are provided in the file as comments.
